# Update DNS for Zones in CloudFlare through API in TypeScript

First we need to set up correctly the dns.yml file (there's a dns.yml.example for it) with the correct values from CloudFlare API access and the domains and DNS records we want to update.

Then simply:
```
npm install
npm start
```

That's all!
